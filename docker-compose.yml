    # Build locally:
    build:

    # Options 2
    # Don't build: use a image previously built with docker command:
    # 2.1: Local previously built with
    #      docker build . -t localhost/biblioteca:testing
    # In this case, we call to local cache:
    # image: localhost/biblioteca:testing
    #
    # 2.2: Local previously built, and pushed to registry
    #      docker build . -t hub.supercanal.tv:5000/biblioteca:testing
    #      docker push hub.supercanal.tv:5000/biblioteca:testin
    # image: hub.supercanal.tv:5000/biblioteca:testing
    # Option 3 - Bring from intranet registry
    # 3.1: local cache
